# Neural-Processing-of-Emotional-Musical-and-Nonmusical-Stimuli-in-Depression


In the last decade, functional MRI (fMRI) has been increasingly impor-
tant in brain cognitive science and Neuro-Psychiatric diagnosis research.

The goal of this work was to observe and analyze brain functions of a De-
pressive and non-Depressive persons using Emotional Musical Stimuli. We

propose a novel approach to analyze BOLD signals from different anatom-
ical regions of interests (ROI) to investigate which ROI(s) differ most from

control subjects in patients of MDD in the presence of musical stimuli. In

order to perform our analyses we have preprocessed the fMRI data and ex-
tracted voxel-wise BOLD signals in this work. The principal components

(PC) of the BOLD signals were used for SVM classification. Our analyses
show that the Occipital Pole obtains the best classification accuracy. The
Frontal Orbital Cortex, Inferior Frontal Gyrus (pars triangulris), Lateral

Occipital Cortex (inferior division) also obtained decent classification ac-
curacy. Thus we hypothesize that, these ROI have better impact on major

depressive disorder (MDD). We conclude that the brain activity in Major
Depressive Disorder (MDD) in these regions differs from control subjects
in presence of emotional musical stimuli.
